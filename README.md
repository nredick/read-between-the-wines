# MAISHACKS 2022: Read Between The Wines

## Inspiration
Alcoholism

## What it does

Read between the wines is an interactive platform designed to provide users with a comfortable interface to truly understand the quality of their wine of choice.
Consequently, it allows users to further explore their options and get a deeper understanding of the no-no juice.
This is achieved by presentation correlations between wine quality and environmental factors, and utilising this information to further determine quality of wine.

## How we built it

Idk Leki and Nat did most of the work

## Challenges we ran into

* We tried to implement the frontend using Velo and discovered it is not permissive enough for our purposes. We therefore decided to build the frontend by ourselves.
* With plentiful data, we had to take the time to brainstorm and properly understand the best factors that might go into the quality of wine, in order to avoid cluttering our data with unnecessary information.
* We got kicked out of the university building at night and had to improvise a new work location

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Everything!

## What we learned

* Frontend sucks

## What's next for Read Between the Wines

Some sleep

## Built With
